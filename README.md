# README

This is an educational project for making a simple full-stack application with React and Node.js. I followed this tutorial here: https://medium.com/zero-equals-false/how-to-connect-a-react-frontend-with-node-js-bccb1fb7e2bb

## Functionality

This project uses the [inspirational-quotes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inspirational-quotes) npm library in the backend to generate quotes that get sent to the front end

### How to run:

* Start the node.js server by "cd'ing" into the backend directory and running `node app.js` which starts up on port 5000

* Start the front end view by "cd'ing" (via a separate terminal) into the frontend directory and running `npm start` which starts up on port 3000
